	  Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? We have a saboteur aboard. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Damage report! This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Your head is not an artifact! You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I'll alert the crew. You enjoyed that. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Travel time to the nearest starbase? I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Not if I weaken first.
